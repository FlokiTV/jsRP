2. Execute the build script.

   ```bash

   ```

3. Start development.

**Disclaimer**

This is a development resource, if you don't use the exports the resource itself will do nothing.

```cfg
setr fivem-appearance:locale "en"
ensure fivem-appearance
```

RegisterCommand('customization', function()
  local config = {
    ped = true,
    headBlend = true,
    faceFeatures = true,
    headOverlays = true,
    components = true,
    props = true,
  }

  exports['fivem-appearance']:startPlayerCustomization(function (appearance)
    if (appearance) then
      print('Saved')
    else
      print('Canceled')
    end
  end, config)
end, false)
```

**Start player customization with callback (TypeScript)**

```typescript
const exp = (global as any).exports;

exp["fivem-appearance"].startPlayerCustomization((appearance) => {
  if (appearance) {
    console.log("Customization saved");
    emitNet("genericSaveAppearanceDataServerEvent", JSON.stringify(appearance));
  } else {
    console.log("Customization canceled");
  }
});
```

**Set player appearance (TypeScript)**

```typescript
const exp = (global as any).exports;

onNet("genericPlayerAppearanceLoadedServerEvent", (appearance) => {
  exp["fivem-appearance"].setPlayerAppearance(appearance);
});
```
